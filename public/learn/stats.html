<h1> General Information & Statistics </h1>

<div style="text-align: left">
    <p>
        Did you know? Just by recycling from the comfort of your home, you will be contributing to the
        greater good of the environment and be part of a global community working towards preserving and
        conserving the ecosystem! Let us have a look at some facts below:
    </p>


    <h3>Each year kerbside recycling in Victoria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            saves over 11,000 megalitres of water (enough to fill more than 4,500 Olympic sized swimming pools)
        </li>
        <li>
            prevents 386,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere
            (equivalent to taking more than 64,000 cars off the road for a year)

        </li>
        <li>
            saving energy used in the extraction, refining, transportation and processing of
            raw materials into products and reducing greenhouse gas emissions
        </li>
        <li>
            decreasing the amount of rubbish sent to landfill and reducing the need for new waste disposal facilities
        </li>
        <li>
            decreasing the amount of rubbish sent to landfill and reducing the need for new waste disposal facilities

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steel and aluminium</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Making new products from recycled steel cans helps save up to 75% of the energy and
            40% of the water needed to make steel from raw materials. Air pollution is also reduced by almost 90%
        </li>
        <li>
            Every tonne of steel recycled saves 1,131kg of iron ore, 633kg of coal and 54kg of limestone
        </li>
        <li>
            Aluminium is almost endlessly recyclable
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Glass</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Glass can be recycled indefinitely
        </li>
        <li>
            Recycling one glass jar saves enough energy to power a 100-watt light bulb for four hours,
            or a fluorescent bulb for 20 hours
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Paper</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Recycling one tonne of paper saves three cubic metres of landfill space
        </li>
        <li>
            Paper and cardboard products made from recycled material conserves trees,
            and their production uses up to 50% less energy and 90% less water than making them from raw materials
        </li>
    </ul>
